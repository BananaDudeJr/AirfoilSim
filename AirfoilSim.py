    "NACA 2412": "Classic general-purpose airfoil, used in Cessna 172. Good balance of lift and drag.",
    "NACA 4412": "Higher camber than 2412 â†’ more lift at low speeds. Common in older light aircraft.",
    "NACA 0012": "Symmetrical â†’ widely used in aerobatic aircraft and horizontal stabilizers.",
    "NACA 4415": "Higher thickness â†’ better low-speed lift. Used in some trainer aircraft.",
    "Clark Y": "Very common training airfoil, forgiving stall, widely used in small planes.",
    "NASA SC(2)-0714": "Supercritical airfoil â†’ designed for transonic cruise efficiency (jets).",
    "NACA 63-215": "Laminar flow airfoil, designed to reduce drag in gliders and racers.",
    "NACA 64-212": "Used on P-51 Mustang â†’ optimized for laminar flow and high efficiency.",
    "Eppler 387": "Popular for model airplanes & gliders. High lift, gentle stall.",
    "MH 32": "Modern sailplane airfoil, excellent low drag at high Reynolds numbers."
